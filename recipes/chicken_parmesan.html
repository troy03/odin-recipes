    <h2>Chicken Parmesan Recipe</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p> 
            <p>2 large eggs</p>      
            <p>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</p>
            <p>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</p>
            <p>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</p>
            <p>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</p>
            <p> ½ cup prepared tomato sauce</p>
            <p>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</p>
            <p>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</p>
            <p>½ cup grated provolone cheese</p>  
            <p>  2 teaspoons olive oil</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <p>Step 1</p>    
            <p>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>   

            <p> Step 2</p>
            <p>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</p>

            <p>Step 3</p>
            <p>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</p>

            <p>Step 4</p>
            <p>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</p>

            <p>Step 5</p>
            <p>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</p>


            <p>Step 6</p>
            <p>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>


            <p>Step 7</p>
            <p>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</p>


            <p>Step 8</p>
            <p> Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</p>

            <p>Step 9</p>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
