    <h2>Creamy Herbed Pork Chops</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>4 thick-cut pork chops</p>
    <p>1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning, or to taste</p>
    <p>½ cup butter, divided</p>
    <p>2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</p>
    <p>1 tablespoon dried basil</p>
    <p> 1 teaspoon instant beef bouillon granules</p>
    <p>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
    <p>2 cups milk</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <p>Step 1</p>
    <p>Season pork chops on all sides with Montreal steak seasoning.</p>
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chops in melted butter until browned and slightly pink in the center, about 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Add remaining butter to the pan as needed so that about 3 tablespoons pan drippings remain in the pan when the chops are finished cooking. Transfer pork chops to a plate and return skillet to medium-high heat.</p>
    <p>Step 3</p>
    <p>Mix flour, basil, and beef bouillon together in a bowl. Stir black pepper into skillet with the pan drippings and cook for 1 minute. Add flour mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until browned, about 2 minutes. Pour milk into flour mixture; cook and stir constantly until mixture is thick and bubbly, 4 to 6 minutes. Pour sauce over pork chops and serve.</p>
